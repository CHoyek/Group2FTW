Assumes that node and npm are installed

Setting up dev env:
1. Clone repo
2. Install mongoDB
3. Open 2 terminal windows
4. In the first window, cd to the project then:
    npm install
5. In the second window:
    mongod -dbpath "/PathWhereYouWantMongodbToPutStuff"
6. In the first window:
    npm run dev <br>
    ("npm start" also works, but "npm run dev" uses nodemon to automatically restart the server when changes are detected, so it's better for development)
7. Go to http://localhost:5000/
